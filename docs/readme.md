# Welcome to Whenner

Whenner is for folks that like to be helpful, take on new challenges, and try new hobbies SO MUCH that they sometimes overcommit, don't finish what they started, and procrastinate on boring-but-important tasks. Whenner is a task calendar (not a task list!) that gives users _time perspective_ by intelligently _scheduling_ tasks. Unlike other task-tracking apps that display a tasks as lists, Whenner maps your tasks to your day so you know exactly what you can and can't get done today, tomorrow, and beyond.

## How Whenner Works

You tell Whenner what you want to do, how long you think it will take, and in what order you want to do it in. Whenner then displays your tasks on a calendar instead of in a list. When there's not enough time to finish
a task before your next appointment or the day's end, it will be automatically pushed off.

The result? You see what you can get done today, and what tasks you can complete before something else interrupts you. Got distracted? No problem. Whenner will keep pushing out your schedule automatically.
Finished a task ahead of time? Congrats! Whenner will tighten your schedule to show what else you can get done with the extra time!
